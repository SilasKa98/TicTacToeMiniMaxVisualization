# A 🧠 TicTacToe MiniMax Visualization 🧠
This project provides an interactive visualization of the Minimax algorithm using the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe. It aims to clearly demonstrate how the algorithm evaluates possible moves and selects the optimal one

# A ✨ Features
* Interactive game board where users can make moves
* Real-time visualization of the Minimax decision tree
* Step-by-step insight into how the algorithm thinks
* Clear distinction between Max and Min nodes

# A 🚀 Getting Started
``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production
npm run build
```

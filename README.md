# A TicTacToe MiniMax Visualization
This project provides an interactive visualization of the Minimax algorithm using the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe. It aims to clearly demonstrate how the algorithm evaluates possible moves and selects the optimal one

# A Features
* Interactive game board where users can make moves
* Real-time visualization of the Minimax decision tree
* Step-by-step insight into how the algorithm thinks
* Clear distinction between Max and Min nodes

# A Getting Started
